# run application

## install dependecies

```
yarn install
// or
npm install
```

## run application

```
yarn start
```

## to take into consideration

despite the size of the application i did use redux for it which is obviously overkill. the purpose of using redux here is in order to in order to propose a better structure of files.

## what I did not do for lack of time (2hrs)

- documentation for the code
- more test
- better ui
- adding additional route for single player
